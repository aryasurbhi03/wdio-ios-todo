# WebdriverIO Project

This project showcases my knowledge of **WebdriverIO** using the **JavaScript** programming language, 
along with the integration of **Allure Reporting**, **BrowserStack**, and **Jenkins** for a complete test automation solution.

# 🚀 Features

- Automated UI testing using WebdriverIO.
- Cross-browser testing support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Integration with **Allure Reporting** for detailed and interactive test results.
- Cloud-based cross-browser testing via **BrowserStack**.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) integration using **Jenkins**.
- Modular and scalable test architecture.
